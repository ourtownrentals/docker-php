README 64 bit ionCube Loader for PHP 7
======================================

This is a beta release of the ionCube Loader non-thread-safe for 64-bit PHP 7 on Linux.
We do *NOT* recommend its use on any production system. It will not, of course, 
work with a 32-bit PHP or a thread-safe PHP.

This will only work with files produced by the PHP 5.6 ionCube Encoder version 9.
So files produced by the PHP 5.5 and lower encoders will not work.


Resolved Issues since beta 4
----------------------------

* Problem with indirect function calls, such as with __call, in PHP 7.0.4+.


Resolved Issues since beta 3
----------------------------

* Running unencoded files with both the ionCube Loader and OPcache enabled would cause a crash.

* In certain cases encoded files would fail if they were run with OPcache also enabled.

* Memory leak that was occurring with the list construct.


 Resolved Issues since beta 2
-----------------------------

* Problem with resolving dynamic keys when method obfuscation was enabled.

* Issues with encapsulated strings (e.g. "  $fields[0]\n").

* Problems with generators.

* Issue with the "short circuit" ternary operator (expr1 ?: expr3).
